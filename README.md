# xbee3_framebuf
This project was forked from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_framebuf and edited to run on XBee3 micropython.  It has been tested on XBee3 TH with 802.15.4 firmware 200A.

The directory struture is as required for the flash.  I suggest that you use PyCharm with the XBee Mycropython Plugin fo the most straightforward experience. Don't forget to exclude unwanted files. 

The main.py program runs as per the test script in the original repo.  Thank you to Adafruit for making this work available :-)

You will see the output at the XBee's REPL prompt.
